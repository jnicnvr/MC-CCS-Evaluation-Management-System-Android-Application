        Mabini Colleges was founded in 1924 in Iriga,<br />Camarines Sur (now Iriga City) as Camarines Sur Institute by the late educator Miguel Rojo Ibana,<br />
        a native of Talisay, Camarines Norte. With an initial enrolent of only 12 students,<br />
        the founder and his students were aptly called “Mr. Ibana and his 12 disciples.”<br />
        From its humble beginnings, the school grew despite difficulties encountered. Through sheer determination,<br />
        perseverance and untold sacrifices, its triumph over the test and vicissitudes of time is considered a monumental<br />
        contribution of Mabini Colleges to the cause of education in Camarines Norte.<br />

        The Monroe Educational Survey Commission, which appraised the condition of private schools in 1928,<br />
        found most private schools all over the Philippines to be hopelessly substandard.<br />
        As a consequence, a vigorous purge of undesirable private schools was instituted which resulted in the closure of 38% of those schools.<br />
        Surviving this purge were only two private schools in the Bicol Region and one of them was the Camarines Sur Institute.<br />
        During the ensuing years, this school gained prestige as the biggest private school in the Region.<br />
        It also changed its name to Apolinario Mabini Institute as a fitting recognition to the ideals and virtues exemplified by<br />
        one of the greatest Filipino heroes and intellectuals admired by the founder.<br />

        Filipino heroes and intellectuals admired by the founder.<br />

        While this school in Iriga was at its zenith, World War II broke out and it did not spare the school from destruction.<br />
        Its building was ruined, its books burned, its equipment and facilities were looted that at the end of the war, <br />
        it had to start from scratch. Capitalization on its pre-war name, the school was preferred and patronized by students. <br />
        The incidental increase in enrolment brought many problems to the school. <br />
        But the founder in a brief period of two years was able to re-establish a higher standard of learning than many other private schools in the region. <br />
        By 1948, it was the leading private school in the Bicol Region. <br />
        The following year, despite the growing enrolment and prestige of the school in Iriga, <br />
        the late founder and his inspiring and self-sacrificing wife, Mrs. Flora Avila-Ibana, decided to transfer the school to Daet,<br />
        Camarines Norte in order to better serve their beloved province for the remaining years of their lives.<br />

        The future of Mabini Colleges is bright. It had gained the confidence and patronage of the people of Camarines Norte and the nearby provinces .<br />
        of Camarines Sur and Quezon.To date Mabini Colleges, in its own humble and sincere way, .<br />
        has been able to provide an efficient and dedicated service to carry on its mission of giving a decent and comparativel.<br />
        y high standard of instruction to the youth of Camarines Norte.<br />

It is in the effective monitoring of performance that the faculty could be appraised as to them critical role as facilitators of learning. According to Grey (2011) implementation of effective faculty evaluation system CEL (Center for Educational Leadership) nationally recognized faculty, staff and consultants have expertise that supports school, district and state in strengthening instructional leadership to improve student learning. We believe that evaluation helps the teachers to expertise their profession to engage students in high quality learning while simultaneously increasing the expertise of school teachers in the improvement process.</string>
